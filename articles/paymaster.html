        <p>Enter Recipient's Address: Paste the address where you want to send the crypto (this could be an exchange address, another wallet, etc.). Always double-check that the address is correct and matches the network you're sending on.</p>
        <p>Select the Token: Choose the cryptocurrency you wish to withdraw.</p>
        <p>Enter the Amount: Specify the amount of crypto you want to send. Ensure you have enough balance, including any network (gas) fees.</p>
        <p>Review the Transaction: Double-check the recipientâ€™s address, the amount, and the network fee before confirming.</p>
        <p>Confirm the Transaction: Enter your PIN code or confirm via fingerprint or FaceID to complete the transaction.</p>

        <p><strong>Wait for Confirmation</strong>: After submitting, the transaction will be processed by the blockchain. You can track its status within the app or on a blockchain explorer.</p>
