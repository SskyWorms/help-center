        <h2>How to Deposit Crypto to Your Holdstation Wallet</h2>
        <p>Select the Correct Chain: At the top of the main screen, you'll see your current blockchain. Tap it to switch to the chain you'd like to use for the deposit (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon).</p>
        <p>Find Your Deposit Address: Once the desired chain is selected, locate your deposit address. It’s displayed next to your wallet avatar and begins with "0x", which is typical for EVM-compatible addresses.</p>
        <p>Copy the Address: Click the copy button to copy your wallet address.</p>
        <p>Make the Transfer: Paste this address into the "Send" or "Withdraw" field on the exchange or another wallet you’re transferring from.</p>
        
        <p>Holdstation Wallet supports a wide range of Layer 2 solutions and EVM-compatible networks.</p>
        <p><strong>Wait for Confirmation</strong>: After submitting, the transaction will be processed by the blockchain. You can track its status within the app or on a blockchain explorer.</p>
