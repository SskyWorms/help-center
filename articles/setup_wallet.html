        <h2>How to Initially Setup Your Holdstation Wallet</h2>
        <p>Visit Holdstation and download the app from the iOS App Store or Google Play Store, depending on your device.</p>
        <p>&#x2022; For new users: After installing, open the app and select "Create a new wallet". You'll be prompted to create a secure PIN code to protect your wallet.</p>
        <p>&#x2022; For existing users: Select "Import an existing wallet" and enter your Secret Recovery Phrase or Private Key to restore your wallet.</p>
        <p>Once your PIN is set up, click "Continue".</p>
        <p>Be sure to store your Secret Recovery Phrase securely, as it is the <strong>>only way</strong> to recover your wallet.</p>
        

        <p><strong>We do not have access to your recovery phrase and will never ask for it. If someone else gains access to your Secret Recovery Phrase, they will have full control over your wallet.</strong></p>
